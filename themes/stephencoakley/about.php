        <p>With a focus on web technologies, I have taught myself programming skills such as HTML, JavaScript, and PHP since I was in middle school. Since then, I have designed and developed multiple websites for multiple small businesses and groups. I have an eagerness for the new and the innovative; on that note, I have created several of <a href="/projects">my own projects</a> that I work on in my spare time.</p>

        <p>I am primarily a web developer, but I also am familiar with databases and data modeling, desktop programs and GUI apps, shell scripts, and computer repair. I love tinkering, and find myself messing around with anything and everything.</p>

        <p>Besides technology, my passions include playing music, writing incomplete fiction stories, and sleeping. When I'm not coding for fun, I'm coding for work, coding for nonprofit organizations, working on college homework, reading tech blogs, or reading fiction.</p>

        <p>I am currently losing sleep to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at <a href="http://uww.edu">University of Wisconsin-Whitewater</a>.</p>
